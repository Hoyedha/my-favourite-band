  <p>My favourite band is Maroon 5.It is led by a world-class singer by the name of Adam Levine.He is well known in the music industry and has built for himself
    quite a reputation.But sadly the group disbanded in 2016 due to some rows within the group from Camilla wanting to leave.But it is not the first time a group has
    disbanded because a bandmate wanting to leave.

    <p>Another famous band by the name of Fifth Harmony also split in 2016 because it was obvious from the beginning that the was only one star among the group of five
      girls.There were many rumours surrounding Camilla Cabello, who left.It was speculated that her and her bandmate were having an affair.This took a toll on all the
      girls which resulted into them crying all the time with Normani, being of dark complextion getting most of the hate.

  <h2>About the Band</h2>
  <div class="column">
    <p>It was formed in April 2012 and have been together for about 4 years.They were a hit as soon as they started making music and shot to the top of the billboards
      after their first album release "Yours".Their concerts were always full, the girls were always screaming the boys names all the time.But they loved Adam the most
      which resulted in friction being created amongst the band.Which ultimately resulted in their demise.Adam comtinued to be famous as the others lost their fame and
      their careers.
